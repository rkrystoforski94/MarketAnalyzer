# MarketAnalyzer
During  integrating qt with vs I have changed QT version in MarcetAnal project options.
Properties->Qt Project Settings -> Qt Installation ->
My QT installation is named "Qt6.4"
Yours is different ("QT 6.4.1")
You may need to change it to work.
Because of a lot of changes with solution paths, I needed to push with that change.
You can change it like it was before my push.

P.S.
If you decide this note is not required or important for this project, please remove it.
Otherwise leave it as it is. In future there should be instalation / use instruction.
